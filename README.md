# tertiaryMigrationCurrentDistributionFoam
 It is described how to simulate tertiary current distribution (including the effect of migration of ions) in electrochemical reactors with the help of OpenFOAM, the developed solver potentialMigrConcentrationFoam and the BC as codedMixed. It shows how to pre-process, run and post-process a basic case involving in a 2D domain.  The proposed strategy allows to have as an input k-th electrochemical reactions per electrode.
